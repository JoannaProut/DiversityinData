#Notable Black Achievements
#The 'first' achievements in various fields have historically marked footholds, often leading to more widespread cultural change. The shorthand phrase for this is "breaking the color barrier"
#"[Black] history is about much more than chronicling a series of “firsts.”  The time and place of a breakthrough reflects not only remarkable individual achievement but is itself an indication of the progress or lack of progress of black people in realizing the centuries-old intertwined goals of freedom, equality, and justice." ~ blackpast.org
